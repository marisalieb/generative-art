# Notes

this is my first time using turtle so im just trying a bunch of differnt variations

####

#### create a base theme file so you dont need all the setup and colours each time


### Tiling:

start by drawing horizontal and vertical lines and then randomise which is being drawn

then recursion split up canvas into ever smaller portions only draw if reached the final level

and introcuse different modes so straight and diagonal


### Nested Squares

idea from the computer graphics and art journal from munich university

set up draw square function

nested loop for xy coordinates so create the outer squares first 
and then the inner squares with nooise so they land in random positions within that noise 
and a shrink factor so they get smaller


### falling squares

move to location
rotate (or not yet)
draw square
then add noise to rotation


### square drop

similar to falling square but work with distance and more noise variation



### alien alphabet

create an original point

a start point
then draw, end and reset

also converted to class in alien02



## fractal tree

repetitive action but add a bit of randomness,

later introduce randomness


### euler spiral

basically just have a step size,angle and numver and then turn a little bit on each step

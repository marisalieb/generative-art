## Generative Art

A collection of generative art using the turtle module

The most recent project files are all in the reworked-files-and-variations dir and all use the same setup file; I've kept the older, more chaotic files separtely 

Each file runs on its own (only using the base file for the theme setup) and produces an image, each image is unique

# 
### Example images:
![alt text](<images/gen art pics.png>)

#
### Theses are the basic project files:
1. basic tiling 
2. nested quares
3. alien alphabet/ alien class (that one uses more oop)
4. falling squares / square drop
5. trees
6. euler spirals

### Variations and mixed concepts:
7. abstract square tiling ( still in progress)
8. multi shaded squares
9. rainbow squares
10. squares and tiling (still in progress)
11. tree circle
12. square drop (variation of falling squares)
13. square drop fade
14. spirals in colour (still in progress)
15. rainbow squares
16. double rainbow squares

# 

### Keep working on:
- squares and tiling so theres nested squres in the tiles
- try6 and try7
- abstract squares
- spirals in colour, esp the draw patterns functions
